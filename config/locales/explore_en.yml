        A spoon, a taste, a world:

      introduction: |-
        This is not just the history of one family. Eighty years after her
        grandmother Jesusita arrived in the US, Jane Shanahan arrived at UNL with
        a collection of documents that she wanted to translate. The result of
        that initial effort is this digital archive that brings together the
        documents and personal correspondence of some members of three
        generations of the same family. This is an interdisciplinary,
        collaborative and bilingual project that allows us to learn about
        language, culture, and society. While manipulating these objects, we can
        learn about different aspects of Mexican American experience in the
        Midwest.
