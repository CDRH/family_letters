      introduction: |-
        This is not the history of just one family. Eighty years after her
        grandmother Jesusita arrived in the US, Jane Shanahan arrived at UNL with
        a collection of documents that she wanted to translate. The result of
        that initial effort is this digital archive that brings together the
        documents and personal correspondence of some members of three
        generations of the same family. This is an interdisciplinary,
        collaborative and bilingual project that allows us to learn about
        language, culture, and society. While manipulating these objects, we can
        learn about different aspects of Mexican American experience in the
        Midwest.

        <p>The greeting cards in this collection have much to tell us about the
        time they were made, and about the social experience of the people who
        sent and received them. The speak about design aesthetics, about
        representations of femininity and masculinity, about social
        obligations, about religious beliefs and about ties of kinship and
        affection. They preserve traces of the contact of Spanish and English,
        and the features of a social network that changed in shape and
        membership over the course of several decades.</p>
        <p>Ornate and elaborate, these fifty one surviving cards were sent to
        commemorate birthdays, holidays, and other milestones like the birth of
        a child. They were used to send wishes of health and to update family
        and friends that were far away. They performed the most important
        function of maintaining human connection across distances.</p>

      title: Of language and life
      intro_html: |-
        <p>Jesusita Baros Torres lived for half a century in the United States.
        This collection preserves samples of over three decades of her personal
        correspondence. These documents offer researchers a unique perspective
        into the individual results of sustained, intense, and asymmetrical
        language contact.</p>
        <p>Linguistic analysis of her correspondence allows us to study the
        type and intensity of the influence of English over her writing in
        Spanish over the course of time, as well as writing features,
        grammatical structures and dialectal features of Mexican American
        varieties of Spanish in that region of the United States.</p>
        <p>At the core of this collection are 83 letters, cards and personal
        notes exchanged between Colorado and Nebraska by Jesusita Baros Torres
        and her daughter, Santos Baros Schubert, between 1956 and 1971. These
        letters provide us with environmental, household and individual clues
        to explain why this intense linguistic contact resulted in
        non-acquisition, loss or maintenance of Spanish by different members
        of the same family.</p>

        <p>In many ways, the objects in this collection can be read as a map of
        the physical movement of three generations of the same family across
        two countries, and later, across several states within the same
        country. These digital objects, dated between 1835 and 1986, include
        personal letters, documents, miscellaneous items, and photographs.
        Personal letters were sent from ten locations in Mexico and 28
        locations in the United States, to three locations in Mexico and 11
        locations in the US.</p>
        <p>In other ways, this collection also serves as the partial record of
        the transit between childhood and adulthood, between dependence on the
        family and economic self-reliance, between one ethnolinguistic
        community to another, between citizenship of one nation to citizenship 
        of another, between socioeconomic strata, and between rural and urban
        identities. Reading these images as one would read a ship’s logbook,
        we find the account of the many ways in which several members of this
        family navigated through, around, and often against, racial, gender,
        ethnic and social expectations of their time.</p>
    more_than_work:
      title: We are more than our work
      intro_html: |-
        <p>The way in which we earn a living is a very important part of who we
        are, especially among immigrants; but the description of our work does
        not capture the whole of our experience. The letters, photographs,
        lyrics, and other digital objects in this collection highlight the
        complex dimensions of Mexican American communities.</p>
        <p>Through these objects we access a story of family struggle,
        adaptation and resilience. We enter the local parish, and meet a group
        of friends; we visit school and local businesses. We get news of the
        death of a baby, and find out about someone’s highway accident. We go
        to a dance. We know who’s getting married and what gifts they got. We
        know how many boys in the neighborhood are off to war, and what is the
        best part of town to buy a house, and whether they’re showing a
        Spanish-language movie this weekend, and what’s for Christmas Eve
        dinner.</p>
        <p>We get a taste of summer picnics, songs, laughter and love stories.
        We taste the dreams, the plans and aspirations that fuel our work and 
        bind together a family, a community, a way to see the world.</p>
