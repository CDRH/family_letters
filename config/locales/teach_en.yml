        This letter is to greet you: Language, migration and daily life in the
        experience of one Mexican American family
      introduction_html: |-
        <p>The following materials were designed to address the needs of High
        School and college Spanish learners at the intermediate/advanced
        levels. Our general goal is to allow students to use the resources of
        the Shanahan collection to develop their linguistic skills and their
        cultural competence as they learn about the experience of Mexican
        American families at the start of the Twentieth Century.</p>
        <p>The activities presented here were developed to address the needs of
        two types of students: Those who are speakers of Spanish as a heritage
        language, and those who are learning it as a second language.</p>
        <p>Following Beaudrie y Potowski (2014), we believe that speakers of
        Spanish as a heritage language bring with them linguistic, social and
        cultural knowledge that must be valued in the classroom. We understand
        a heritage language learner as a student who grew up in a family  or
        community environment where a minority language was spoken, and who
        possesses an affective and cultural connection with that language.</p>
        <p>We acknowledge the fact that, in the context of the United States,
        most Spanish classrooms serve both types of students. Each teacher will
        be free to adapt this material (and the other resources in the
        collection), to address the specific needs of her students.</p>
