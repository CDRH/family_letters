        Language, migration and daily life in the experience of one Mexican
        American family
      introduction_html: |-
        <p>The following materials were designed to address the needs of High
        School and college Spanish learners at the intermediate/advanced
        levels. Our general goal is to allow students to use the resources of
        the Shanahan collection to develop their linguistic skills and their
        cultural competence as they learn about the experience of Mexican
        American families at the start of the Twentieth Century.</p>
        <p>The activities presented here were developed for two types of
        students: Those who are speakers of Spanish as a heritage
        language, and those who are learning it as a second language.</p>
        <p>Following Beaudrie y Potowski (2014), we believe that speakers of
        Spanish as a heritage language bring with them linguistic, social and
        cultural knowledge that must be valued in the classroom. We understand
        a heritage language learner as a student who grew up in a family  or
        community environment where a minority language was spoken, and who
        possesses an affective and cultural connection with that language.</p>
        <p>We acknowledge the fact that, in the context of the United States,
        most Spanish classrooms serve both types of students. Each teacher will
        be free to adapt this material (and the other resources in the
        collection), to fit the specific needs of their students.</p>

      warning: |-
        The description of the teacher resources in this section was written in
        English taking into consideration that, in the context of the United
        States, teachers of Spanish are part of a school community that
        includes administrators, colleagues and parents that may not know how
        to read in Spanish. Instructions for students were written in Spanish
        because this is both the language of instruction and the object of
        study of these pedagogical units.
