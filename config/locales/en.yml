      <p><em>The Family Letters</em> project preserves, digitizes, analyzes and
      makes public a collection of the correspondence and other personal
      documents of a Mexican American family that migrated from the state of
      Zacatecas, Mexico, to the states of Colorado and Nebraska during the first
      half of the twentieth century.</p>
      <p>The objects in this collection allow us to learn about the life of
      Latin@s in the Midwest at the start past century. They also provide us
      with a better understanding of the impact of migration on their everyday
      lives. The features of their writing and the events narrated in these
      letters provide us with important clues about the varieties of Spanish
      they spoke, and about their overall language experience.</p>
      <p>Even though Mexican immigrants started to arrive in the Midwest at the
      end of the nineteenth century, their experience and their writing have
      remained mostly forgotten. This site outlines the trajectory of a family
      whose members exchanged personal letters written in Spanish and English
      over the span of several decades. These documents allow us to observe the
      ways in which broader historical events intertwine with the lives of
      ordinary people.</p>

        <h4>Basic Search</h4>
        <p>Simply enter the word you wish to find and the search engine will search for every instance of the word in the journals. For example: Fight. All instances of the use of the word fight will show up on the results page.</p>
        <h4>Wildcard Searches</h4>
        <p>Using an asterisk (*) will increase the odds of finding the results you are seeking. For example: Fight*. The search results will display every instance of fight, fights, fighting, etc. More than one wildcard may be used. For example: *ricar*. This search will return most references to the Aricara tribe, including Ricara, Ricares, Aricaris, Ricaries, Ricaree, Ricareis, and Ricarra. Using a question mark (?) instead of an asterisk (*) will allow you to search for a single character. For example, r?n will find all instances of ran and run, but will not find rain or ruin.</p>
        <h4>Capitalization</h4>
        <p>Searches are not case sensitive. For example: george will come up with the same results as George.</p>
        <h4>Phrase Search</h4>
        <p>Searching for a specific phrase may help narrow down the results. Rather long phrases are no problem. For example: "This white pudding we all esteem".</p>
        <h4>Subsequent Searches</h4>
        <p>Because of the creative spellings used by the journalists, it may be necessary to try your search multiple times. For example: P?ro*. This search brings up numerous variant spellings of the French word pirogue, "a large dugout canoe or open boat." Searching for P?*r*og?* will bring up other variant spellings. Searching for canoe or boat also may be helpful.</p>
