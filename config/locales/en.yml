      collaboration_q: How can I contribute to this project?
      types_q: What type of materials make up this collection?
      types_a: |-
        This collection is composed of 713 digital objects dated between 1835
        and 1986. It includes 225 letters, 199 documents, 19 miscellaneous
        texts, and 270 photographs. 149 letters in this collection were written
        entirely in Spanish or include writing in Spanish. The personal
        correspondence in this collection was sent between 10 locations in Mexico
        and 28 locations in the United States, to 3 locations in Mexico
        and 11 locations in the United States.  This collection also includes
        the transcription and translation of cards and other written documents
        partially or entirely in Spanish, as well as the transcription and
        translation of some personal correspondence that was originally written
        in English.
      access_q: How can I gain access to these materials?
      access_a_html: |-
        <p>The materials in this collection are available to the academic
        community for research purposes. All requests for access should be
        addressed in writing to the director of this project and must include
        the following information:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Name, position and institution of the applicant</li>

        </ul>
        <p>As the principal institution of higher education in the state of
        Nebraska, one of the central values of UNL is to share knowledge
        which benefits the communities of our state. With this in mind, the
        materials in this collection are also available to schools, civic
        organizations, and those interested in knowing more about experience
        of Latinos/as in our region. All requests of this type may be
        addressed by contacting the director of this project in writing.</p>
      conventions_q: |-
        What orthographic conventions do you follow in transcriptions and
        translations?
      conventions_a: |-
        Taking into consideration the objects of our research and the
        preservation of these materials, the spelling in the letters and
        documents in this collection was transcribed faithfully. In the case
        of translations we follow the spelling conventions of the target
        language, aiming for maximum intelligibility.

        <p>Our team considers interdisciplinary and inter-institutional
        collaboration to be our central value. We seek to encourage this
        collaboration through the exchange of data, methodology, tools, and
        other products derived from our intellectual pursuits. We want our
        work to contribute to the conversation between researchers on both
        sides of the border between the United States and Mexico, and in
        other academic communities interested in the migratory experience.</p>
        <p>We hope that all the intellectual products derived from this project
        will contribute to the well-being and health of Mexican-American
        communities, wherever they may be.</p>

      <p>The <em>Family Letters</em> project is an effort to preserve, digitize, analyze and share with the public a collection of the letters and other personal documents of a Mexican American family that migrated from Zacatecas, Mexico, to Western Colorado and Eastern Nebraska, during the first half of the Twentieth Century.</p>
      <p>The objects in this collection allow us to learn about everyday life for Latinos at the start of last century, and help us to better understand the impact of their experience of migration on their day to day. The writing features and the events narrated in these letters provide us with important clues about the Spanish that was used by Mexican American families during this period, and about their linguistic experience.</p>
      <p>Despite the fact that Mexican immigrants started to arrive in the Midwest since the end of the Nineteenth Century, their experience and their writing have remained mostly forgotten. This site describes the life trajectory of a family whose members exchanged letters written in Spanish and in English between Mexico and the United States, over the course of several decades. These documents allow us to observe the way in which larger historical events are intertwined with the lives of ordinary people.</p>

        <h4>Basic Search</h4>
        <p>Simply enter the word you wish to find and the search engine will search for every instance of the word in the journals. For example: Fight. All instances of the use of the word fight will show up on the results page.</p>
        <h4>Wildcard Searches</h4>
        <p>Using an asterisk (*) will increase the odds of finding the results you are seeking. For example: Fight*. The search results will display every instance of fight, fights, fighting, etc. More than one wildcard may be used. For example: *ricar*. This search will return most references to the Aricara tribe, including Ricara, Ricares, Aricaris, Ricaries, Ricaree, Ricareis, and Ricarra. Using a question mark (?) instead of an asterisk (*) will allow you to search for a single character. For example, r?n will find all instances of ran and run, but will not find rain or ruin.</p>
        <h4>Capitalization</h4>
        <p>Searches are not case sensitive. For example: george will come up with the same results as George.</p>
        <h4>Phrase Search</h4>
        <p>Searching for a specific phrase may help narrow down the results. Rather long phrases are no problem. For example: "This white pudding we all esteem".</p>
        <h4>Subsequent Searches</h4>
        <p>Because of the creative spellings used by the journalists, it may be necessary to try your search multiple times. For example: P?ro*. This search brings up numerous variant spellings of the French word pirogue, "a large dugout canoe or open boat." Searching for P?*r*og?* will bring up other variant spellings. Searching for canoe or boat also may be helpful.</p>
