      <p>The <em>Family Letters</em> project is an effort to preserve, digitize, analyze and share with the public a collection of the letters and other personal documents of a Mexican American family that migrated from Zacatecas, Mexico, to Western Colorado and Eastern Nebraska, during the first half of the Twentieth Century.</p>
      <p>The objects in this collection allow us to learn about everyday life for Latinos at the start of last century, and help us to better understand the impact of their experience of migration on their day to day. The writing features and the events narrated in these letters provide us with important clues about the Spanish that was used by Mexican American families during this period, and about their linguistic experience.</p>
      <p>Despite the fact that Mexican immigrants started to arrive in the Midwest since the end of the Nineteenth Century, their experience and their writing have remained mostly forgotten. This site describes the life trajectory of a family whose members exchanged letters written in Spanish and in English between Mexico and the United States, over the course of several decades. These documents allow us to observe the way in which larger historical events are intertwined with the lives of ordinary people.</p>

        <h4>Basic Search</h4>
        <p>Simply enter the word you wish to find and the search engine will search for every instance of the word in the journals. For example: Fight. All instances of the use of the word fight will show up on the results page.</p>
        <h4>Wildcard Searches</h4>
        <p>Using an asterisk (*) will increase the odds of finding the results you are seeking. For example: Fight*. The search results will display every instance of fight, fights, fighting, etc. More than one wildcard may be used. For example: *ricar*. This search will return most references to the Aricara tribe, including Ricara, Ricares, Aricaris, Ricaries, Ricaree, Ricareis, and Ricarra. Using a question mark (?) instead of an asterisk (*) will allow you to search for a single character. For example, r?n will find all instances of ran and run, but will not find rain or ruin.</p>
        <h4>Capitalization</h4>
        <p>Searches are not case sensitive. For example: george will come up with the same results as George.</p>
        <h4>Phrase Search</h4>
        <p>Searching for a specific phrase may help narrow down the results. Rather long phrases are no problem. For example: "This white pudding we all esteem".</p>
        <h4>Subsequent Searches</h4>
        <p>Because of the creative spellings used by the journalists, it may be necessary to try your search multiple times. For example: P?ro*. This search brings up numerous variant spellings of the French word pirogue, "a large dugout canoe or open boat." Searching for P?*r*og?* will bring up other variant spellings. Searching for canoe or boat also may be helpful.</p>
