      <p>The materials in this collection are available to members of the
      academic community for research purposes. This collection includes 713
      digital objects dated between the years 1835 and 1986. These include 225
      personal letters, 199 documents, 19 miscellaneous items, and 270
      photographs. One hundred and forty nine letters in this collection were
      written entirely in Spanish or include some writing in Spanish. Seventy
      three documents in the collection were written entirely in Spanish or
      contain some writing in Spanish. Personal letters included in this
      collection were sent from ten locations in Mexico and 28 locations in the
      United States, to three locations in México and 11 locations in the US.
      The collection includes transcription and translation of all letters and
      other documents written partially or wholly in Spanish, as well as
      transcription and translation of selected correspondence originally
      written in English.</p>
      <p>As the leading institution of higher education in the state of
      Nebraska, one of UNL’s core values is that the knowledge generated by our
      university benefit the communities in our state. With this in  mind, the
      materials in this collection are also available to schools, as well as
      civic and cultural organizations interested in learning more about Latinx
      experience in our region. All questions, comments, or collaboration
      proposals must be emailed to Isabel Velázquez, director of this project.</p>

        <p>This map reconstructs the trajectory of each letter, document and
        photograph in this collection. At an individual level, examining the
        spatial and temporal distribution of these documents allows us to see
        the social networks and linguistic shift in three generations of the
        same family.</p>
        <p>At a collective level, these patterns describe translational and
        internal migratory routes that are the origin of many Mexican American
        communities in the United States, and that exist today. To see each
        item in context, you can hover over any point in this map and click.</p>
