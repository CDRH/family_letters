      spirit_a_html: |-
        <p>Our team considers interdisciplinary and inter-institutional
        collaboration to be our central value. We seek to encourage this
        collaboration through the exchange of data, methodology, tools, and
        other products derived from our intellectual pursuits. We want our
        work to contribute to the conversation between researchers on both
        sides of the border between the United States and Mexico, and in
        other academic communities interested in the migratory experience.</p>
        <p>We hope that all the intellectual products derived from this project
        will contribute to the well-being and health of Mexican-American
        communities, wherever they may be.</p>
