      spirit_a_html: |-
        <p>We hold inter-disciplinary and inter-institutional collaboration as
        central values of our research team. We seek to foster this
        collaboration through the exchange of data, research instruments and
        methodologies, and other products derived from intellectual effort. We
        seek to contribute our work to the academic conversation on both sides
        of the US-Mexico border, and to any other academic community interested
        on the experience of migration.</p>
        <p>It is our hope that every intellectual product derived from this
        project contributes to the wellbeing and strengthening of Mexican
        American communities and families wherever they may be.</p>
